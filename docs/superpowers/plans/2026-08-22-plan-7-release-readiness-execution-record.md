# Plan 7 execution record

This records what happened while executing
`docs/superpowers/plans/2026-08-22-plan-7-release-readiness.md`.

## Starting state

- Package branch point: `f9dea76d8b0e1b1a341bf1071557eeefc351afb2` on local `main`; the repository has no remote.
- Implementation worktree: `/Users/mikelmao/Projects/laravel-nodeflow/.claude/worktrees/plan-7-release-readiness` on branch `plan-7-release-readiness`.
- The locked Plan 6 worktree remained untouched.
- Demo commit: `e15e5bd912fee2e248654861b826d9e1458707dc` on `main`.
- Demo package link: `/Users/mikelmao/Sites/test-workflow/vendor/atram/laravel-nodeflow` resolved exactly to `/Users/mikelmao/Projects/laravel-nodeflow`.
- Package baseline: Pest 904 tests / 7,469 assertions; Vitest 160 tests across 17 files; TypeScript silent; Composer metadata valid.
- Demo baseline: Pest 56 tests / 223 assertions; TypeScript silent; production build passed; Composer metadata and lock consistency valid with the known unbound local-package warnings; worktree clean.

## Counterfactuals

### Task 1: G-12 — installed-Vite config precedence

- RED (before production change): `vendor/bin/pest tests/Feature/Install/ViteStepsTest.php --compact` produced 3 failures, 8 passes, and 20 assertions. In the multi-candidate fixture, installed Vite selected `vite.config.js` while PHP read the earlier `vite.config.ts`, yielding `CannotWire` instead of `AlreadyPresent`; standalone `vite.config.cjs` and `vite.config.cts` fixtures also yielded `CannotWire` because PHP omitted both candidates.
